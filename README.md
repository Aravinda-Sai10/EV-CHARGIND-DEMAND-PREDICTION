# EV-CHARGIND-DEMAND-PREDICTION
This project uses a deep learning LSTM model to forecast future electric vehicle demand using historical EV adoption data. By modeling cumulative EV growth at the county level and deploying an interactive web application, the system supports data-driven charging infrastructure and energy planning for sustainable mobility.
